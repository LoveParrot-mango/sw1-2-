It took us about 2 months to construct this and we are delighted with the result. Now at lunch time, all students from grade 5-8 would be brought here,in the cafeteria, to have their lunch. Moreover, the students are recommended to bring thier own lunch but if they don't, we serve food. It is available for everyone with a lunch and without thier lunch. Looking forward to see all the youngsters eating in their classrooms and the seniours prattling in the cafeteria!</p>
